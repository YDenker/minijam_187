## Rules
* Not reading the rules is not an excuse for breaking them.
* It is mandatory that you incorporate the jam's limitation into your game. This said, how you choose to interpret its meaning and go about incorporating it is entirely up to you.
* You cannot submit previously made games to the jam. This jam is about creating something new in the given period of time. Games made before the jam will be removed.
* Any and all NSFW content, potentially offensive content, graphic content etc. must be clearly telegraphed with a content warning at the start of the game or in its description or cover.
* You will be prompted to answer a few questions when submitting your game. Please answer them to the best of your ability. Giving vague answers is a great way to set off red flags.
